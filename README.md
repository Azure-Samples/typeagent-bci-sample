# 🧠 Brain-Adaptive Agent Sample powered by TypeAgent and fNIRS device

This repository is a work in progress demonstration showcasing how AI Agents can be personalized using Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI).

The goal of this project is to explore how brain signals (fNIRS) can be used to customize and enhance interactions with AI Agents, creating a more personalized and intuitive experience. It is powered by [TypeAgent](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeAgent) and [Azure AI Foundry](https://ai.azure.com/), and uses the [BlueberryX BCI Device](https://blueberryx.com/) to collect brain signals.

> [!WARNING] 
> Status: Work in Progress.

## 🌟 Overview

This is an experimental project that combines:

- 🧠 fNIRS brain activity data
- 🤖 AI Agent interactions, mediated by TypeAgent
- 🎯 Personalization through neural signals

### 🔍 Architecture Overview

The system architecture consists of several key components:

1. **Input Sources**
   - 🎤 Various input methods including voice, text, email, and Teams messages
   - 🧠 Biosensors (fNIRS) for brain activity monitoring
   - 🏌️ Specialized sports equipment (Golf Hat) for performance metrics

2. **Azure Platform Integration**
   - ⚡ Event Grid and Event Hubs for real-time event processing
   - 🚀 Container Apps hosting the TypeAgent-powered Meta Agent
   - 🤖 Specialized sub-agents for different tasks (research, design, meditation, etc.)

3. **Data & AI Services**
   - 💾 Cosmos DB for data storage
   - 🧠 Azure OpenAI Service with multiple models (GPT-4o, o3-mini, DALL-E 3)
   - 🛠️ Azure AI Foundry for agent services and tools
   - 🔍 Azure AI Search and Data Explorer for data analysis

4. **Generated Outputs**
   - 📊 Brain state-adjusted research reports and diagrams
   - 🧘 Personalized meditation instructions
   - 📨 Automated communications
   - 🎯 Interactive golf performance analysis

The architecture is designed to be scalable and modular, allowing for easy addition of new input sources, agents, and output types. The system uses brain-computer interface data to personalize and optimize the AI interactions for each user.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- 📦 Node.js (v16 or higher)
- 📦 pnpm (v8 or higher)
- 🗺️ Azure Maps subscription key
- 🧠 [BlueberryX BCI Device](https://blueberryx.com/) for fNIRS data

### 🔧 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-name>
```

2. Install dependencies using pnpm:
```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   - Edit `.env` and add your Azure Maps subscription key:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_AZURE_MAPS_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY=your_azure_maps_key_here
   ```

### 🗺️ Getting Azure Maps API Key

1. Go to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com)
2. Create a new Azure Maps account or use an existing one
3. Navigate to your Azure Maps account
4. Go to "Authentication" in the left sidebar
5. Copy your primary key
6. Paste it in your `.env` file

### 💻 Development

1. Start the backend server:
```bash
cd backend
pnpm install
pnpm build    # Build the TypeScript files first
pnpm start
```
The backend API will start on port 4518.

2. In a new terminal, start the frontend development server:
```bash
# In the root directory
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```
The frontend application will be available at `http://localhost:4517`.

For development with hot reload on the backend:
```bash
cd backend
